     *      Probing both tabs after publish: the login tab has zero download controls
     *      (getByLabel('Download') = 0, #download-btn = 0), the editor tab has them. That
     *      is the 2026-08-18 run's "element(s) not found after 120s", and — once the
     *      context tore down mid-wait — its "Target page, context or browser has been
     *      closed" while waiting for the download event.
     *   2. FIREFLY-ERA LOCATORS. download_img() clicks getByText('Selected image'), which
     *      belongs to the text-to-image generation panel. The template editor's download
     *      panel has no such control (probe count: 0) — it has a file-format picker.
     *
     * Being on EditorDashboard rather than AdobePage is the actual fix: this class is

     * come back the next time the flow changes which tab that is.
